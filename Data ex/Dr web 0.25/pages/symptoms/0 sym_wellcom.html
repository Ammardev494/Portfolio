            <p>Tell us a bit about yourself and how youâ€™re feeling for suggested next steps and common treatment plans. 
                Take the time to make some notes about your symptoms before you call or visit the doctor. 
                Worrying about your symptoms is not a sign of weakness. 
                Being honest about what you are experiencing doesn't mean that you are complaining.
                Questions to ask yourself about your symptoms:
                What exactly are my symptoms?
                Are the symptoms constant? If not, when do I experience them?
                Does anything I do make the symptoms better? Or worse?
                Do the symptoms affect my daily activities? Which ones? How?
